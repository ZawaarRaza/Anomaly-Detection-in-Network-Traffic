# AI-Powered Network Traffic Anomaly Detector

This project uses unsupervised machine learning (Isolation Forest) to detect anomalies in network traffic using the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

## Features
- Preprocess and scale structured network data
- Apply Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- Visualize normal vs. suspicious traffic using PCA

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Place the dataset in `/data` as `UNSW-NB15.csv`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open and run the notebook in `/notebook/anomaly_detection_unsw.ipynb`
